This is a modified version of the Splatter software package (https://github.com/Oshlack/splatter) constructed as a class project for CMSC 701: Computational Genomics.

Since this project is an extension of an existing package, it contains a lot of code that I did not write. All of the important modifications can be found in R/splat-simulate.R (there are also some modifications to files that R uses to build packages, but those are not really worth looking at). Within that script, the modifications I made are localized to the following functions: `splatSimulateMod()`, `grnIsValid()`, `splatSimCrisprGroupDE()`, `splatSimCrisprGroupCellMeans()`, and `getCrisprLNormFactors()`
